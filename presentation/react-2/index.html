<ul>
<li>UI building blocks in React are Components. Independent and reusable.</li>
<li>Component can be considered as function that takes props and returns an element</li>
<li>React 'reacts' on changes (state, props) and updates UI when it is needed.</li>
<li>Data on input -&gt; UI on output</li>

</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h2 id="orgb8f6964">Remember about</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do Not Modify State Directly, use <b>setState()</b></li>
<li>The data flows down. From parent to child</li>
<li>React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance
to reuse code between components.</li>

</ul>
</section>

<h2 id="orgd3d0296">Context</h2>
<p>
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without
having to pass props down manually at every level.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org21c502a">When to Use Context</h3>
<p>
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for
a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user,
theme, or preferred language.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org51f8baa">Before You Use Context</h3>
<p>
Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by
many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly
because it makes component reuse more difficult.
</p>

<h2 id="org4117677">Error Boundaries</h2>
<p>
In the past, JavaScript errors inside components used to corrupt
React’s internal state and cause it to emit cryptic errors on next
renders. These errors were always caused by an earlier error in the
application code, but React did not provide a way to handle them
gracefully in components, and could not recover from them.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orgfa1899a">Introducing Error Boundaries</h3>
<p>
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors
anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display
a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orga7d3951">Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree.</li>
<li>Errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree.</li>
<li>Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers.</li>

</ul>
</section>

<h2 id="org91fdf4b">Fragments</h2>
<p>
A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple
elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding
extra nodes to the DOM. (<b>&lt;React.Fragment&gt;</b>)
</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h2 id="org0285671">Higher-Order Components</h2>
<p>
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for
reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per
se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature.
</p>

<p>
<b>Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.</b>
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org2920bc3">Notes</h3>
<p>
HOC doesn’t modify the input component, nor does it use inheritance
to copy its behavior. Rather, a HOC composes the original component
by wrapping it in a container component. A HOC is a pure function
with zero side-effects.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="org34b598b">Don’t Mutate the Original Component. Use Composition.</h3>
<p>
Resist the temptation to modify a component’s prototype (or otherwise mutate it) inside a HOC.
</p>
</section>

<h2 id="org646a72f">Portals</h2>
<p>
Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node
that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
</p>

<p>
<b>ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)</b>
</p>

<h2 id="org30fce00">Refs and the DOM</h2>
<p>
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.
</p>

<p>
In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent
components interact with their children. To modify a child, you
re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you
need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-sec-">
<h3 id="orga0f9e06">When to Use Refs</h3>
<p>
There are a few good use cases for refs:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.</li>
<li>Triggering imperative animations.</li>
<li>Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively.
