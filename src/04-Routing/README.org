*04-Routing* 

1. Implement *Loading* component with *Render-props* pattern
2. Move most of *onCatch* from Forest to Playground component
3. Implement *Notification* component about 'Catch!' action. Use Bulma class.
4. Use *portals* ReactDOM.createPortal(<Component/>, DOMElement)
   Notifications are not kept between routes
5. Use *Fragments* in NotificationList
6. Extract custom hook *useNotifications* (Notify about 'Rules of Hooks')
7. Lift the state up (Notifications). Show that notifications now keep while routing.
8. But we need to pass props throught all child components
9. Switch to next step. And show Trainer's bag component
