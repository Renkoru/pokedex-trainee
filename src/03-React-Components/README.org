*03-React-Components* 

1. Split on two scenes
   - *Trainer*
     1) Extract whole user from Forest container
     2) In *App* component check *window.location.pathname* and show needed content
     3) Add *Navigation* component, use links
     4) Refactor links to modify window pathname
     5) Write your own *Router*
        - window.history.replaceState({}, name, path);
        - const [route, setRoute] = useState(window.location.pathname);
        - Create *Router* component (React.Children.forEach)
     6) Trainer and its pokemons should be in sharead state. *"Lifting state up"* principle
     7) Use ReactRouter
   - *Forest*

* TODO:
